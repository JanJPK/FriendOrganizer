MVVM + EF project based on an online course - https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/wpf-mvvm-entity-framework-app/table-of-contents.

So far im happy - the course is very professional and shows not only how to create a program but also many shortcuts and mechanics of VS2017 i had no idea about.
